SummerVelo is the culmination of my 18 weeks at Launch Academy.

Designed to help users better plan their upcoming cycling season, the app integrates with the BikeReg.com API to serve real cycling events from around the country. Users can search as broadly as an entire region of the country or by event type, or - thanks to Google's Geocode API - as specifically as a radius around a given location.

Users can also create and join teams, and once a member can save events to one or more of their teams so the team can coordinate which events they want to attend together.

All events also have weather forecasts, even for events that are months out, thanks to an integration of the DarkSky API.

A live demo of the site, which utilizes Amazon S3 hosting, is available at https://summervelo.herokuapp.com
